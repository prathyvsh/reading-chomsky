* Reading Chomsky

Catalogue of articles/books from Chomsky with some notes.

* Concepts

** Universal Grammar
** Innatism
** Surface structure vs. Deep Structure

Surface structure is derived from a deep structure. Chomskian grammars can be represented using a ruleset that describes a tree using terminals and non-terminals. Surface structure can be thought of as the terminal yield of a deep structure.

TODO: Can terminal yields be linked with fixed point idea in Mathematics?

** Terminals and Non-Terminals

** Derivation Trees
Like in programming language syntax/semantics studies, the derivation trees of a context free language is thought of as generating the final surface structure. Say Ana sees a rose. A same sentence with an equivalent meaning such as A rose is seen by Anna, would have analogous deep structure when its derivation trees are examined.

TODO: This looks like something that will become evident if you use a Lambda Calculus / Sequent calculus like derivation system. Have these been proven? What is a good example to be listed here?

** Terminal Yield
When unfolding a tree, the final objects found at the end of each trees derivation is said to collectively form the terminal yield.

** X-Bar Theory
** Minimalist Program
